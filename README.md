# CAUTION: DOES CONTAIN FAST FLASHING IMAGES!
# flash-me
A pointless plugin to flash the background-color and color attributes of an element. repeatedly.

Gives you the ability to change the colors, speed & transitions. Totally pointless.

At some point this readme will actually be usefull. but for now, just take a look at the demo code.
